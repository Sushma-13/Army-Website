<h1>MCO</h1>
The activities of EME Regimental Association are governed by a "Governing Body", which is a General Committee of
Trustees and nominated members. To assist the "Governing Body" in framing of the policies and procedures concerning
areas such as welfare measures, financial management, Customs and traditions of the Corps history and archives, promotion
of Sports and Adventure, public relations and others such like regimental activities, a set of committees has been
instituted. The "Executive Committee" oversees the functioning of all the other Committees.
Quick response of the system is of paramount importance to ensure timely help to the needy personnel.
